### LEADERSHIP COACH

Hi, I'm Tobey, a professional abstract artist, international speaker, and leadership coach based in Boston.

Agility is not just for code. The world keeps changing, and not always for the better. Your people need you to show up for them, even when the ground keeps shifting beneath you.

I help _smart, self-aware professionals_ navigating transitions, crises, and re-skilling — without judgment. You don’t have to mask or over-explain yourself; I coach with nuance, flexibility, and respect for your lived experience.

We won’t just talk about your challenges, we will build the solutions side by side.
